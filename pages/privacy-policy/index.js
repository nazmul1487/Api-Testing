        <h6># Cookies and other related technologies</h6>
        <p>
          To personalize your experience of our website, services or to support
          any of the promotions /offerings, we may assign your computer browser
          a unique random number (cookie) or similar technologies. &apos;Cookies
          and related technologies enhance website performance in important ways
          like personalizing your experience or making your visit and
          interactions more convenient. Your privacy and security will not be
          compromised when you accept a cookie from our website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salextra generally treats data we collect using these cookies and
          similar technologies as non-personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or
          similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also
          treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In
          addition, Salextra sometimes combines non-personal data collected from
          these technologies with other personal data Salextra holds. When we
          combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data
          for purposes of this Privacy Policy
        </p>
        <p>
          You can remove or reject cookies using your browser or device&apos;s
          settings. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust
          some preferences every time you visit
          https://applestore.salextra.com/, and some services and features may
          not work.

        <h6># Security of Personal Data</h6>
        <p>
          We take protection and security of your Personal Information seriously
          and will employ reasonable security practices and procedures to ensure
          its safe storage and use as per the applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>We follow accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We also maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, no information transmitted over or accessible through the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we attempt to protect all Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant that Personal Information will be completely secure from misappropriation by hackers or from other nefarious or criminal activities, or in the event of a failure of computer hardware, software, or a telecommunications network. We will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your personally identifiable information (as defined by the applicable law) stored by or for us. If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us immediately. By disclosing your email address to us for any reason, you expressly consent to receive electronic notice from us in the event of such a security breach.</p>
